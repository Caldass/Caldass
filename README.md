# About me
  
I'm currently a Commercial Intelligence Assistant at [Cardeal Distribuidora](http://cardealdistribuidora.com.br/) who's completely in love with AI and Data Science. I'm also a Business undergrad at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE).
  
At Cardeal Distribuidora I apply Data Science solutions to business problems, building sales forecasting and customer segmentation models, reports, dashboards and I also perform commercial checks and validations.
  
I have already developed many Data Science solutions such as a tool that predicts the outcome of a soccer match in order to make profit out of betting odds and a rent estimator for the capital of my state in order to help people find price worthy properties.
  
The details of each solution are described in the projects below.
